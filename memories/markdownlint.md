# Markdown linting (markdownlint, lint-qmd)

Split out of [`tools.md`](tools.md) on 2026-09-01 when that file crossed the 1250-line budget `scripts/check-memory-file-size.py` enforces.

- **Table rows must stay on one line (MD055/MD056).**
  Wrapping a cell across lines breaks the `|` alignment and trips both rules.
  Rewrite the cell concisely on a single line rather than word-wrapping it.
  Prefer a short, complete description over hitting a length target.
- **MD056 counts a literal `|` inside a code span as a cell delimiter -- backticks do not protect it.**
  ai-config#2906 went red on `lint-markdown` because two hook-catalog rows contained `` `HH:MM PDT|PST|PT` `` (a regex-style alternation written in backticks).
  `memories/hooks.md:69` reported "Expected: 5; Actual: 7",
  and `README.md:405` reported "Expected: 3; Actual: 5".
  The rule scans the raw row text for `|`, so a code span's contents are counted exactly like bare table syntax, splitting one cell into three and inflating the column count.
  **Do:** spell alternatives out in prose (`` an `HH:MM` stamp suffixed `PDT`, `PST`, or `PT` ``) instead of writing a `|`-joined alternation, in backticks or not, inside a table cell.
  **Don't:** write a regex-style alternation containing `|` in a table cell and trust the backticks to shield it -- MD056 reads raw text, not rendered Markdown.
  (Morrison-Lab/ai-config#2906, 2026-09-01.)
- **Don't tag a non-shell CLI block `bash`/`sh` (MD040).**
  MD040 wants a language on every fence, which invites tagging anything command-shaped as `bash`.
  Claude slash commands (`/ums`, `/plugin`, `/also`) and other application-level directives are not shell-executable, so `bash` implies a reader can run them and they fail when someone tries.
  Tag those `text` instead.

(Recovered 2026-07-30 from `a739c69`, an orphaned commit on `ums/ardi-review-link-handling`: it landed about 30 minutes after its own PR [#650](https://github.com/Morrison-Lab/ai-config/pull/650) merged, so it never reached `main` and sat unnoticed for a week.
Both rules were first learned on [#645](https://github.com/Morrison-Lab/ai-config/pull/645).)
