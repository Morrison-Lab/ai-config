Fail fast; no silent failures.
Detect bad state as early as possible and stop with a clear error,
rather than proceeding and letting the failure surface later — or
never — as silently wrong output.

## In code

- Validate inputs and assumptions at the top of a function —
  `stopifnot()`, or `rlang::abort()` with a clear message — instead of
  letting a bad value flow into a confusing downstream error or, worse,
  a plausible-looking wrong result.
- Don't swallow errors.
  A bare `except:` in Python, an R
  `tryCatch(..., error = function(e) NULL)`, or a shell `|| true` hides
  the failure without fixing it.
- When a fallback is genuinely wanted — graceful degradation at a
  system boundary, a retry for a known-transient failure — make it
  explicit and observable: message the degradation, bound the retries,
  and document why the fallback is safe.
- In CI, a step that can fail should fail the job, not
  `continue-on-error` its way to a green check.
  The exception is a deliberate pattern that re-checks the outcome
  downstream (e.g. `d-morrison/gha`'s `continue-on-error` review
  attempts feeding a single resolve-outcome step that still fails the
  job when neither attempt succeeded) — the failure is deferred and
  handled, not ignored.

## In a check you run by hand

The rule is easiest to break in the throwaway one-liner you write to
verify your own work, because there the swallowed failure does not
produce a wrong result -- it produces a **clean bill of health**, which
is worse.

The shape to watch for is a verification command whose failure path and
whose pass path print the same thing:

```bash
# Wrong -- "none" means "no matches" OR "grep never ran"
grep -P '[\x{2014}]' file || echo "none"
```

`grep` exits non-zero both when it finds nothing and when it errors out,
so a bad pattern, an unreadable file, or an unsupported flag reports
exactly like a clean file.
Nothing looks wrong, and the check is now worse than not having run one,
since it converts an unknown into a confident "verified".

Make the two outcomes distinguishable.
Test the exit status explicitly (`rc=$?`, treating 0 as found, 1 as clean,
anything else as an error), or write the check in a language that raises on
a bad pattern and print an explicit count -- a check reporting `0 hits` out
of a stated number of lines examined cannot silently mean "examined
nothing".

This is [`algorithmatize-checks`](../workflow/algorithmatize-checks.md)'s
partner: that rule says build the instrument instead of eyeballing, and
this one says an instrument that cannot fail loudly is not yet an
instrument.

(ai-config#754, 2026-07-28: a pre-push scan for banned punctuation used
`grep -P '[\x{2014}...]' || echo "none"`.
PCRE rejected the pattern with "character code point value in \x{} or \o{}
is too large", and the `||` branch printed `none`, which read as a pass.
A rewrite in Python found a real em-dash on an added line.)

## In review

Flag error handling that hides failure — swallowed exceptions, silent
defaults substituted on failure, unbounded retries, `continue-on-error`
without a downstream outcome check — the same weight as any other
standing review check.
Ask for the explicit form: an early validation, a loud error, or a
documented, observable fallback.

This serves the Reliable goal in the
[principles catalog](README.md): a loud failure is easier to catch than
a silent one.
