# Clean Branches (aka CB / prune)

Audit branches in the current repo — **both your local checkout and the
remote**. Delete dead ones, rebase stale ones, open MRs for orphaned work, and
sweep up local-only stragglers — all without disrupting active sessions.

## When this fires

- User says "clean branches", "cb", "prune", "prune branches", "tidy up branches"
- User says "clear dead branches", "clean up the repo"
- User says "what branches can we delete?"

## Scope: local AND remote

Prune in both places — they accumulate junk independently:

- **Remote** branches — dead/stale/orphaned remote refs (the bulk of this skill).
- **Local** branches — branches that linger in your checkout after their PR
  merged, or whose upstream remote was deleted (`[gone]`). The remote pass
  alone won't catch a local branch whose remote is already gone, so there's a
  dedicated local pass (step 8).

## Definitions

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Dead** | Purely behind main (no unique commits ahead), no open MR, no linked issue, not created in the last 7 days | Delete |
| **Stale** | Has unique commits ahead of main but is behind main, no recent activity (>30 days), not actively being worked on | Rebase on main, open MR if none exists |
| **Active** | Has an open MR, linked issue, recent commits (<30 days), or a claim comment | Skip — don't touch |
| **New** | Created in the last 7 days | Skip — too fresh to judge |
| **Local merged** | *Local* branch fully merged into main, or whose PR merged (upstream `[gone]`) | Delete locally (`git branch -d`) — step 8 |
| **Local-only unpushed** | *Local* branch with unique commits, never pushed, no MR | Flag — ask before touching (step 8) |

The first four rows apply to **remote** branches (steps 1–7); the last two are
the **local** pass (step 8). A branch can need both — e.g. delete the remote ref
*and* the leftover local tracking branch.

## Procedure

### 1. Detect the forge

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Determine GitHub (`gh`) vs GitLab (`glab`).

### 2. Fetch and list remote branches

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git branch -r --merged origin/main | grep -v 'origin/main\|origin/HEAD'
git branch -r --no-merged origin/main
```

### 3. Classify each branch

For each remote branch (excluding `main`, `HEAD`, protected branches):

#### a. Check if it's purely behind main (merged/dead)

```bash
# Commits on branch not on main (ahead count)
git rev-list --count origin/main..origin/<branch>

# If 0 → branch is purely behind main (already merged or never diverged)
```

#### b. Check recency

```bash
git log -1 --format='%ci' origin/<branch>
```

Skip if created/last-committed within the last 7 days (too new).

#### c. Check for open MR/PR

```bash
# GitLab
glab mr list --source-branch=<branch> 2>&1 | cat

# GitHub
gh pr list --head=<branch> --json number,title,state | cat   # LIST_PRS
```

If an open MR exists → **Active**, skip.

#### d. Check for linked issues

Look for branch naming patterns that reference issues:
- `fix/123-*`, `feat/123-*`, `issue-123-*` → check if issue #123 is open
- If the linked issue is open → **Active**, skip

#### e. Check for active work claims

```bash
# Look for recent "working on this" / claim comments on any linked MR/issue
```

If a claim comment exists within the last 24 hours → **Active**, skip.

### 4. Present the plan (dry run)

Before taking any action, present a table to the user:

```
## Branch Cleanup Plan

| Branch | Last commit | Status | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| `old-feature` | 2025-03-15 | Dead (merged) | 🗑️ Delete |
| `wip-refactor` | 2025-11-20 | Stale (45 days, no MR) | 🔄 Rebase + open MR |
| `fix/42-typo` | 2026-06-15 | Active (open MR !80) | ⏭️ Skip |
| `experiment` | 2026-06-12 | New (<7 days) | ⏭️ Skip |

Proceed? (or pick specific branches to act on)
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding. If user says "just go" or
"do it", proceed with all proposed actions.

### 5. Delete dead branches

```bash
git push origin --delete <branch>   # DELETE_REF
```

Also clean up local tracking branches:
```bash
git branch -d <local-tracking-branch>  # if it exists locally
```

### 6. Rebase stale branches

For each stale branch:

```bash
git checkout -B <branch> origin/<branch>   # -B (not -b) force-resets if the branch already exists locally
git rebase origin/main
```

If rebase has conflicts:
- Attempt to resolve automatically (see the `resolve-conflicts` skill —
  consolidate both sides, don't blind-pick)
- If conflicts are non-trivial, skip this branch and report it
- Don't force-push a broken rebase

If rebase succeeds:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>   # PUSH
```

### 7. Open MRs for orphaned stale branches

For stale branches that have no open MR after rebasing:

```bash
# GitLab — assign to the current glab user (override ASSIGNEE to assign someone else)
ASSIGNEE="$(glab api user 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['username'])")"
glab mr create --source-branch=<branch> --target-branch=main \
  --title "<inferred title from branch name>" \
  --description "Orphaned branch rebased onto main. Review or close if no longer needed." \
  ${ASSIGNEE:+--assignee "$ASSIGNEE"}

# GitHub
gh pr create --head=<branch> --base=main \
  --title "<inferred title>" \
  --body "Orphaned branch rebased onto main. Review or close if no longer needed."   # CREATE_PR
```

### 8. Prune local branches

The remote pass doesn't touch branches that only exist in your checkout. Sweep
those too. First refresh remote-tracking state so "merged" and "gone" are
accurate:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin                       # marks deleted upstreams as [gone]
git branch --show-current                      # never delete the branch you're on
```

**The `--prune` is a prerequisite, not a refresh --- without it step b finds
nothing and reports success.** `[gone]` is produced *by* pruning, not by the
branch being deleted upstream: until a prune runs, `%(upstream:track)` is
empty for exactly the branches b exists to find, so its `grep` matches zero
rows and the sweep says there is nothing to clean.
The "nothing found" and "never ran" paths print the same thing,
so never take a zero-row result as clean
unless this fetch actually ran in this sweep.

Recommend the standing setting once, since it makes every other tool's view
correct too --- but keep the explicit `--prune` above regardless, so the sweep
does not depend on the user's config:

```bash
git config --global fetch.prune true          # or per-remote:
git config --global remote.origin.prune true
```

That setting only prunes `refs/remotes/origin/*`.
It never deletes a local branch, so it replaces none of the steps below.

Classify each **local** branch (excluding `main`/`master`/protected and the
current branch):

#### a. Merged into main → delete

```bash
git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE '^\s*\*|^\s*main\s*$|^\s*master\s*$'
# Line-anchored so only the literal `main`/`master` lines (and the current `*`
# branch) are excluded — a branch like `maintain-docs` or `feature-main-menu`
# is NOT silently filtered out.
# Compare against origin/main (just fetched), NOT local `main` — your local main
# may be behind, which would hide branches that are actually merged.
git branch -d <branch>          # -d refuses if NOT actually merged — a safety net
```

`-d` (never `-D`) is deliberate: if git refuses, the branch has unmerged
commits — treat it as **stale**, not dead (see b).

#### b. Upstream gone but the PR merged → delete

A branch whose remote was deleted shows `[gone]`:

```bash
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)' refs/heads \
  | grep '\[gone\]'
```

For each, confirm the PR/MR actually merged before deleting (never assume):

```bash
# GitHub
gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged --json number,mergedAt | cat   # LIST_PRS

# GitLab
glab mr list --source-branch=<branch> --state merged 2>&1 | cat
```

- PR merged → `git branch -D <branch>` is acceptable here (the work landed via
  squash/rebase merge, so `-d` may not see it as merged). Confirm the merge
  first.
- No merged PR and unique commits exist → **stale local work**: don't delete;
  offer to push it and open an MR (step 7 mechanics).

**Read the PR, not local ancestry, to decide whether the work landed.** In a
repo that squash-merges --- `ucdavis/bcs` and `Morrison-Lab/ai-config` both do
--- a branch whose work is already on `main` still reports a non-zero
ahead-count, is not an ancestor of `main`, is absent from
`git branch --merged`, and is refused by `git branch -d`.
All four say "unmerged" about a branch that merged,
because the squash commit is a different commit.
So treat a `-d` refusal as *unproven*,
never as evidence the branch holds unique local work ---
that is what the merged-PR lookup above is for,
and why `-D` is the right tool once it comes back positive.

The converse still holds and is what keeps this safe: no merged PR **and**
unique commits means the work may exist nowhere else,
so it is never deleted without confirmation.
When the PR lookup is inconclusive,
check content rather than ancestry, since content survives a squash:

```bash
git show origin/main:<path> | grep <something-the-branch-added>   # did it land?
```

#### c. Never pushed, has unique commits → keep, but flag

```bash
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(upstream)' refs/heads \
  | awk '$2=="" {print $1}'      # local branches with no upstream at all
```

Report these as "local-only, unpushed" and ask before doing anything — they may
be in-progress work that hasn't been pushed yet. Don't delete without
confirmation.

Apply the same dry-run discipline to local deletions as step 4 does for remote
branches — **no silent local deletions**. If you're doing a full local+remote
sweep, fold these local rows into the step-4 plan and present them together; if
you're running the local pass on its own, present a standalone local plan here
and wait for confirmation before deleting anything.

### 9. Report

Print a summary covering **both** local and remote:

```
## Branch Cleanup Complete — <timestamp>

### Deleted — remote (dead)
- `old-feature` (last commit 2025-03-15, merged into main)

### Deleted — local (merged / upstream gone)
- `add-wrap-up-skill` (PR #26 merged; local straggler)
- `ums-session-learnings` (merged into main)

### Rebased + MR opened (stale)
- `wip-refactor` → [!85](url) (rebased, 3 commits ahead)

### Skipped (active/new)
- `fix/42-typo` — open MR !80
- `experiment` — created 2 days ago

### Flagged — local-only, unpushed (left alone)
- `scratch-idea` — 4 unpushed commits, no MR; your call

### Failed (conflicts)
- `ancient-branch` — rebase conflicts, needs manual resolution
```

## Safety rules

- **Never delete `main`, `master`, `develop`, or any protected branch.**
- **Never force-push to a branch with an open MR** without rebasing cleanly.
- **Always present the plan first** — no silent deletions.
- **Check for active work** before touching any branch.
- **Preserve local branches** the user is currently on (`git branch --show-current`).
- **Don't delete branches newer than 7 days** — they might be in-progress work
  that just hasn't gotten an MR yet.
- **Prefer `git branch -d` over `-D`** for local deletions — `-d` refuses unless
  the branch is merged, which catches "I thought this landed but it didn't."
  Only use `-D` after confirming the PR merged (squash/rebase merges can leave a
  local branch that `-d` won't recognize as merged).
- **Never delete a local-only unpushed branch without confirmation** — if it has
  unique commits and no remote, that work exists nowhere else.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`sync-pr-branch`** — used internally when rebasing stale branches
- **`claim-pr`** — checked to avoid touching claimed branches
- **`ardi`** — user may want to ARDI the newly opened MRs afterward
- **`clean-worktrees` / `cw`** — the worktree counterpart. This skill sweeps
  *branches*; that one sweeps the *worktrees* a branch is checked out into. Run
  both so neither a dead worktree nor an orphaned branch lingers.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Deleting branches without checking for open MRs/issues first
- ❌ Force-pushing a broken rebase
- ❌ Touching branches that someone is actively working on
- ❌ Deleting branches without user confirmation
- ❌ Rebasing branches that have open MRs (use merge instead, or skip)
