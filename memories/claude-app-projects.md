# Claude app and Claude Projects: device access and thread state

What a session on the user's own computer through the Claude app can reach, and how to tell what a Claude Project thread is actually doing.
Split out of `tools.md` when a 2026-10-02 append crossed its 1250-line gate.

## macOS privacy blocks the Claude app from network volumes; a Terminal tab can read them

On the user's Mac, a render that reads a file from a mounted network share (for example the S-drive at `/Volumes/biostatistics`) fails when run from the Claude app, because macOS privacy controls (TCC) deny the app access to network volumes.
The same command succeeds from a Terminal tab, which the user has already granted access (measured 2026-10-01 on the abridge manuscript render).

- **Do:** run the command in a Terminal tab, or ask the user to, when a Claude-app session gets a permission error on `/Volumes/...`.
- **Don't:** conclude the share is unmounted or the file is missing from that error alone.

## Claude Projects: confirm a thread's own session state before saying it is running

In a Claude Project, a "remote control session active" notice inside a thread can belong to the coordinator session rather than to that thread's own session.
On 2026-10-02 one was read as "the thread resumed" when the thread was actually parked, and the user was told work was running when it was not.
The user chatting from their Mac also does not mean Remote Control is serving the folder the thread needs.

- **Do:** check `rc_session_status` for that thread (running, connected, served) before reporting that a device thread is working.
- **Do:** say plainly when a claude.ai setting or UI path is not visible, rather than guessing a menu path;
  on 2026-10-01 there was no visible way to remove a Library context folder, and a guessed path would have sent the user looking for a control that did not exist.
- **Don't:** infer a thread's state from a notice that names no session.
