# push-memory

Persist a **general-purpose** memory to the `ai-config` repo **from a session
whose working repo is something else** (a product repo, `gha`, a data-analysis
repo). This is the cross-repo companion to `memorize`: same routing and voice
rules, different delivery.

`memorize`'s commit/push step assumes `ai-config` is your primary checkout,
symlinked into `~/.claude/` by `bootstrap.sh`, with direct push to `main`. That
breaks when you're elsewhere:

- A session scoped to another repo may not have `ai-config` checked out at all —
  the `~/.claude/memories` symlink can be absent or dangling.
- Remote/web sessions can often push only to their assigned branch, so a direct
  push to `ai-config`'s `main` is rejected (`HTTP 403`).
- The current git context is the *other* repo, so a naive commit tangles the
  memory into that repo's branch and working tree.

So this skill locates (or sidesteps) an `ai-config` checkout and delivers the
memory on its own branch + PR, never touching the repo you're working in.

## When this fires

- "push this to ai-config", "add this to ai-config's memory / `CLAUDE.md`",
  "remember this globally from here", "record this in ai-config even though
  we're in `<other repo>`", "/push-memory".
- Any time you have a standing rule or reference fact worth keeping, the lesson
  is general (not tied to the repo you're in), and `ai-config` is **not** your
  working repo.

If `ai-config` **is** your working repo (you're on its `main`, symlinked, with
push access), use `memorize` — it's the shorter path. This skill is for the
cross-repo case.

## First: is it actually a general-purpose memory for ai-config?

Two things route elsewhere before you go further:

- **Project-specific fact** — a convention or gotcha tied to ONE repo ("this
  repo renders with renv via `R_LIBS_USER`"). That belongs **not** in shared
  `ai-config`, but routed by ownership (see `memorize`); don't push it here:
  if we own the repo, commit it to that repo's own agent docs (`CLAUDE.md`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or whatever it already has) via a PR,
  falling back to its local Claude project memory
  (`~/.claude/projects/<project-path>/memory/`) as short-lived staging only
  when it has no agent-doc infrastructure yet — in that case, update
  `MEMORY.md` in that directory as an index entry, and hand off that
  a PR adding agent-doc infrastructure to that repo (plus migrating the
  staged memory there) is still needed. If it's an **external repo we
  don't own**, never open a direct PR **autonomously** — follow
  [`upstream-issues`](../../shared/workflow/upstream-issues.md) (policy
  check, draft, explicit user approval) and stage in local project memory
  until approved, updating that directory's `MEMORY.md` as an index entry
  too.
- **Automated every-time action** ("after each commit run X"). Memory can't
  execute it — that's a **hook** in `settings.json` (use `update-config`). Say
  so and route it there.

What stays: a **general standing rule** ("always link PRs in tables") → `CLAUDE.md`,
or a **general reference fact** ("`gh` opens a pager — pipe to `cat`") → a topical
file in `memories/` (e.g. `github.md`, `git.md`, `debugging.md`
-- see `memories/MEMORY.md` for the full set).
These are exactly
`memorize`'s two "general" scopes.

## Procedure

1. **Route + choose the target file** using `memorize`'s rules: standing rule →
   `CLAUDE.md`; reference fact → the fitting `memories/<topic>.md`. When you add
   a *new* file under `memories/`, also add a row for it to `memories/MEMORY.md`
   (the index). Don't duplicate — if the point is already recorded, update it in
   place rather than stacking a second copy.

2. **Get the current content of the target file(s)** so you append in the right
   place and match the file's voice — and decide your delivery path now, since
   reading and writing both follow it. In a **web/remote session, or with no
   usable local `ai-config` checkout**, use the GitHub file API (**Path A**,
   step 4): read with `mcp__github__get_file_contents` (`owner: d-morrison`,
   `repo: ai-config`). With a **clean local checkout you can branch in**, use a
   local worktree (**Path B**, step 4): read the file there.

3. **Write** a concise bullet (one line preferred), matching the file's voice;
   include the *why* if it isn't obvious. Never edit files in the repo you're
   working in — only the `ai-config` target file(s).

4. **Deliver on a dedicated branch + PR.** Never push straight to `ai-config`'s
   `main`, and never entangle the change with the current repo's branch. Pick the
   path that fits the session:

   **Path A — GitHub file API (remote/web; no local `ai-config` checkout).** The
   robust default when you're in a web session or lack a clean checkout — it
   touches no working tree.

   1. Branch off `main`: `mcp__github__create_branch`
      (`owner: d-morrison`, `repo: ai-config`, `from_branch: main`,
      `branch: memory/<slug>`). In a web session pinned to its assigned branch,
      use that assigned branch name instead.
   2. Read each target with `mcp__github__get_file_contents` (keep the returned
      `sha`), edit locally, then write the updated file(s) on the branch —
      `mcp__github__create_or_update_file` per file, or
      `mcp__github__push_files` for several files in one commit (needed when you
      also touch `memories/MEMORY.md`).
   3. Open the PR: `mcp__github__create_pull_request` (`base: main`,
      `head: <branch>`), body `Closes #<issue>` if a tracking issue exists.

   **Path B — local `ai-config` checkout you can safely branch in.** Resolve the
   repo root via this skill's own symlink (the skill lives in `ai-config`):

   ```bash
   acfg="$(git -C ~/.claude/skills/push-memory rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
   # Fall back to a sibling clone if that isn't a checkout here:
   [ -n "$acfg" ] || for d in ~/ai-config ~/Documents/GitHub/ai-config ../ai-config; do
     [ -d "$d/.git" ] && acfg="$(git -C "$d" rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && break
   done
   echo "${acfg:-NONE — use Path A}"
   ```

   That toplevel is the **main** checkout — it may be on another session's branch
   or hold uncommitted edits. Don't branch in place if it's occupied; add a
   worktree off `origin/main` instead so you never disturb it:

   ```bash
   git -C "$acfg" fetch origin main
   wt="$(mktemp -d)"
   git -C "$acfg" worktree add "$wt" -b memory/<slug> origin/main
   # edit "$wt"/CLAUDE.md or "$wt"/memories/<file>.md, then:
   git -C "$wt" add CLAUDE.md              # or: memories/<file>.md  (+ memories/MEMORY.md when adding a new memories file)
   git -C "$wt" commit -m "memory: <one-line summary>"
   git -C "$wt" push -u origin memory/<slug>
   ```

   Stage only the memory file(s) — never `git add -A`. Open the PR with `gh pr
   create` (or `mcp__github__create_pull_request`), then remove the worktree:
   `git -C "$acfg" worktree remove "$wt"`.

5. **Follow through on the PR.** Opening it triggers the standing watch-and-ARDI
   rule: subscribe to its activity and drive the review to clean. A one-line
   memory PR is usually clean on the first pass, but don't drop it — carry it to
   ready like any other PR.

6. **Confirm**: one sentence — what was stored, which file, and the PR link.

## Don't

- Don't push a **project-specific** fact here — it belongs committed to that
  repo's own agent docs via a PR (its local project memory is short-lived
  staging only, when it has no agent-doc infrastructure yet), not shared
  `ai-config`.
- **For the general-memory-to-`ai-config` path** (the case this skill exists
  for): don't edit or commit anything in the repo you're working in — only
  the `ai-config` target file(s). This doesn't apply to the
  project-specific-fact case above, which commits to the owned repo on
  purpose — including when that owned repo happens to be the one you're
  currently working in.
- Don't push straight to `ai-config`'s `main`, and don't `git add -A` — stage
  only the file(s) you wrote.
- Don't run a full session review or touch skill files (that's `ums`).
- Don't store secrets, tokens, or passwords.

## Relationship to other skills

- **`memorize`** (`remember` / `always`) — the same routing and voice rules for
  the normal case: `ai-config` is your working repo, symlinked, and you push to
  its current branch directly. Reach for `memorize` there; reach for
  `push-memory` when `ai-config` is not the repo you're in.
- **`ums`** — reviews the whole session and may also update skill definitions.
  `push-memory` stores exactly one memory the user names; it never scans or
  edits skills.
- **`update-config`** — where an "every-time action" belongs (a hook), since a
  memory can't execute.
- **`config-ai`** — the broader router across skills/agents/memory/hooks/`gha`
  capabilities; its Step 3 fallback ladder (issue on target repo, then issue
  on the current repo for transfer) covers the case one rung past this
  skill's Path A/B — when the session has no API/branch access to `ai-config`
  at all, not just a different working repo.
